            <p class="text">
                “Success consists of moving from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm.”  <br>
                -Often attributed to Winston Churchill <br>
                This is a quote that continues to help me to this day.<br><br>
                I spent my early 20's working for an Israeli software company that developed a specialized system for the Diamond industry, that manages inventory,
                management, Accounting, and some customer relationship management or CRM tasks. <br><br>
                The company gave me responsibilities that included sequenced query language (SQL) business intelligence report development, sales, and implementation of their software.  <br><br>
                I traveled to countries around the world where I worked with companies to install and troubleshoot the software, keeping up with my tasks in the different time zones.  <br>
                I learned a lot and I got to travel the world.<br>
                I held this position for four years. <br><br>
                When the company opened a New York office, I was asked to help run it.
                I returned to New York self-assured, yet one piece was missing.  
                Although I had honed many skills and built rapport with customers, I wanted education.  <br><br>
                So, I decided I was ready to return to an academic environment.<br>
                I left my position at Fantasy in [2018] and enrolled at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. <br>
                Over the last two years I have continued to build on my knowledge, gained new friends, and have matured in ways that leave me inspired for the future.<br>
                I seek to further my career in computer science and mathematics, and the opportunity to pursue a challenging environment, and to work with others at the top of my field.
